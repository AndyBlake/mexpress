MEXPRESS
========


[MEXPRESS](http://mexpress.be) is a data visualization tool designed for the easy visualization of [TCGA](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) expression, DNA methylation and clinical data, as well as the relationships between them.

This repository contains the back and front-end code to make MEXPRESS run. It also includes the different scripts that are used to download and process the TCGA data that is needed for the tool to work.
